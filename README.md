# Simple React Online Shop

This is a simple React-based online shop project that I created while learning **TypeScript**, **React's Context API**, **memoization**, **filtering**, **searching**, **user details management**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The project uses the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch product and user data, providing a hands-on way to practice these concepts.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to the project for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Product Listing**: Display a list of products fetched from the FakeStore API.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove products to/from the cart.
- **Filter Products**: Filter products by category (e.g., electronics, clothing, etc.).
- **Search Box**: Search for products by name or description.
- **User Details**: Display user details (e.g., name, email) fetched from the FakeStore API.
- **Context API**: Manage global state (e.g., cart items, user details) using React's Context API.
- **Memoization**: Optimize performance by memoizing components and functions using `React.memo` and `useMemo`.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the application with a utility-first approach.


This project was a great way to practice and solidify my skills in TypeScript, React, and modern web development!
